            | Confucius once said "Choose a job you love, and you will never have to work a day in your life", and I finally found mine. After graduating from a hospitality and tourism management institute, and after working in the tourism industry for a while, I figured out where my true passion lies.
            | Nothing matches the rush and the happiness after finishing a perfectly working project, that is what I live for now. 
            | With my previous experience and all the skills that I acquired through my techdegree and the various projects i participated in, I build a solid foundation that enables me to be the next best addition to your team.
